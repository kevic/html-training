   <h1> History </h1>
      </div>
   <p> Frontend development has come a long way since the early days of the internet.
     From the first simple HTML pages to the sophisticated web applications we use today,
      the frontend landscape has evolved dramatically. 
      The prevailing notion once predominantly deemed backend development as the domain for "serious" engineering; 
      however, with the myriad of advancements and transformations, this notion may no longer be the case.
<br>
    Let's take a stroll down memory lane...</p>
    <p>
        Meta frameworks such as Remix are looking to shift the known paradigms that we use today
         with our Single Page Applications. This "new" paradigm is looking to take us back to a simpler time 
         on the web while also bringing along performance enhancements that we have built up along the way. 
         Is this the future that all Meta Frameworks will go? It is too early to say,
          but we already see Vercel taking note with its upcoming changes to Next 13 and its app directory.

        Edge computing is revolutionizing server development, moving processing and data storage closer
         to the source of user interactions. This paradigm shift is poised to significantly 
         improve web performance, reduce latency, and enhance security.
          This will take some of the strain off of individual servers that we
           have to propagate throughout the United States and give the end-user faster responses.

        In contrast to some organizations that opt for the more straightforward approach of iterating 
        and building upon existing legacy code and infrastructure, we remain steadfast in our commitment
         to leveraging the most cutting-edge technology available at any given time.
          This occasionally necessitates the rearchitecting or refactoring of substantial 
          portions of our codebase. We view this as an indispensable
           measure to proactively adapt to the ever-evolving technological landscape.
            By embracing innovation and staying ahead of the curve, 
            we ensure the continuous delivery of unparalleled performance and value to our clients
             and end users.
